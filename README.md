# ACD Lab 2022

Course work of Automata Theory and Compiler Design Lab [IT3230]

## List of Experiments

### Lab 1

1. Write a program to count number of characters, words, whitespaces and number of new lines in a given file.

### Lab 2

2. Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
3. Write a program to check whether the entered string is a keyword or not. If so, then count number of keywords.

### Lab 3

4. Write a program to check whether the entered string belongs to a grammar as per Chomsky Hierarchy (Type-3/Type-2/Type-1/Type-0) or not. If so, then specify type of grammar.

### Lab 4

5. Write a program to separate terminals and non-terminals of the given grammar with its counting number.
6. Design a Program for creating machine that accepts three consecutive one.

### Lab 5

7. Design a Program for creating machine that accepts the string always ending with 101.
8. Design a Program for Mode 3 Machine.
9. Design a program for accepting decimal number divisible by 2.

### Lab 6

10. Design a Program to find 1’s and 2’s complement of a given binary number.
11. Write a Program to match names starting with “Mr” or “Ms”.
