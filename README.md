# ACD Lab 2022

Course work of Automata Theory and Compiler Design Lab [IT3230] for Information Technology Department, MUJ

## List of Experiments

### Lab 1

- [x] 1. Write a program to count number of characters, words, whitespaces and number of new lines in a given file.

### Lab 2

- [x] 2. Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
- [x] 3. Write a program to check whether the entered string has a keyword or not. If so, then count number of keywords.

### Lab 3

- [x] 4. Write a program to check whether the entered string belongs to a grammar as per Chomsky Hierarchy (Type-3/Type-2/Type-1/Type-0) or not. If so, then specify type of grammar.

### Lab 4

- [x] 5. Write a program to separate terminals and non-terminals of the given grammar with its counting number.
- [x] 6. Design a Program for creating machine that accepts three consecutive one.

### Lab 5

- [x] 7. Design a Program for creating machine that accepts the string always ending with 101.
- [x] 8. Design a Program for Mode 3 Machine.
- [x] 9. Design a program for accepting decimal number divisible by 2.

### Lab 6

- [x] 10. Design a Program to find 1’s and 2’s complement of a given binary number.
- [x] 11. Write a Program to match names starting with “Mr” or “Ms”.

### Lab 7

- [x] 12. Design a program for creating a machine which accepts string having equal no. of 1’s and 0’s.
- [x] 13. Design a PDA to accept WCWR where w is any string and WR is reverse of that string and C is a Special symbol.
- [x] 14. Design a Program to create PDA machine that accept the well-formed parenthesis.

### Lab 8

- [ ] 15. Write a program to check whether a given grammar is left recursive, if so, eliminate it. <br>
- [ ] 16. Write a program to remove left factors from a given CFG.

### Lab 9

- [x] 17. Write a program to find FIRST and FOLLOW for the given grammar.

### Lab 10

- [x] 18. Write a program which takes a C source file and create a symbol table. Symbol Table should contain the following fields:
      _Serial no, name, type, scope, size._

### Lab 11

- [ ] 19. Write a LEX program to identify DIGITS, KEYWORDS and IDENTIFIERS
      etc. and give separate count of each.
- [ ] 20. Write a LEX program to add line number to files.
- [ ] 21. Write a LEX program to print out single line comments.
- [ ] 22. Write a LEX program to convert decimal to hexadecimal.

### Lab 12

- [ ] 23. Write a program to identify the given grammar is LL 1 or not.

### Lab 13

- [ ] 24. Write a YACC program to parse any sample source file/language using a given grammar.
